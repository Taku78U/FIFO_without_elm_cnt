# FIFO_without_elm_cnt
This is a FIFO designed for Block RAM, and based on the implementation http://marsee101.blog19.fc2.com/blog-entry-1085.html
An ordinary FIFO has a counter to distinguish between empty and full, but this FIFO do not implenment it. This substitutes extending write pointer and read one by 1bit.
I may use something like this for my research.
