# FIFO_without_elm_cnt
This is a FIFO designed for Block RAM, and based on the implementation described in http://marsee101.blog19.fc2.com/blog-entry-1085.html .
Some FIFOs has a counter to distinguish between a state empty and a state full, but this FIFO does not have it. This substitutes extending write pointer and read one by 1bit.
I may use something like this for my research.
Thanks to marsee101.
